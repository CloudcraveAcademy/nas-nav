                        The Universal Basic Education Commission (UBEC) is committed to enhancing the quality and accessibility of education across the nation. Recognizing the challenges posed by limited infrastructure, unsustainable internet connectivity and unreliable power supply, UBEC is implementing a Solar-powered satellite based e-learning system in 109 schools across the 36 States in Nigeria. This innovative initiative aims to provide continuous and high-quality educational content to primary pupil/students in even the most remote areas of Nigeria. </p>
